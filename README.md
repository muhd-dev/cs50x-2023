# CS50x Problem Set 1-5 Backup

This repository serves as a backup of my progress in Harvard's CS50x course, specifically for problem sets 1 to 5. As I continue my learning journey, I'll be updating and adding to this repository to reflect my growing understanding of the course material.

## Problem Sets Included

This repository contains my solutions (based on research), code, and files related to problem sets 1 to 5 of the CS50x course. Each problem set is stored in its respective directory.

## Repository Structure

- `pset1/`: Problem Set 1 files and solutions.
- `pset2/`: Problem Set 2 files and solutions.
- `pset3/`: Problem Set 3 files and solutions.
- `pset4/`: Problem Set 4 files and solutions.
- `pset5/`: Problem Set 5 files and solutions.

## Updates

As I continue to progress through the course and complete more problem sets, I'll be updating this repository accordingly. Feel free to explore and see how my understanding of the concepts evolves over time.

## How to Use This Repository

You're welcome to use this repository as a reference for understanding how I approached and solved the problem sets in CS50x. Keep in mind that these solutions are based on research and my own understanding and may not be the only way to solve the problems.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational purposes only. While you're welcome to explore my solutions, I encourage you to work on the problem sets yourself and only refer to solutions as a last resort. Plagiarism and academic dishonesty are not in the spirit of learning and can have serious consequences.
