1: Characterizing a listener's audio aura based on their top 100 songs involves calculating
average attributes like energy, valence, and danceability, but this approach might overlook
diverse musical tastes and the varying emotional impact of songs within playlists,
necessitating a more personalized and nuanced analysis.

song context, sentiment analysis of lyrics, real-time user input, and other musical features
as this could provide a more accurate reflection of the listener's evolving emotions and
preferences throughout the year.
